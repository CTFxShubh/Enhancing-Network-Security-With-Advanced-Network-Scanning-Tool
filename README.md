This research paper introduces a sophisticated network scanning tool designed to enhance cybersecurity measures by integrating advanced techniques in operating system (OS) detection, service scanning, and intrusion detection system (IDS) / intrusion prevention system (IPS) detection. The tool aims to provide a comprehensive approach to network security assessment, offering robust capabilities for identifying potential vulnerabilities and mitigating security risks . The OS detection module employs a combination of fingerprinting techniques and heuristics to accurately identify the underlying operating systems of networked devices. This information is crucial for understanding the network environment, enabling administrators to implement targeted security measures . The tool incorporates a sophisticated IDS/IPS detection mechanism to identify and evaluate the effectiveness of intrusion detection and prevention systems in place. This feature is vital for assessing the network’s resilience against potential threats and ensuring that the deployed security mechanisms are robust and up-to-date. The research paper details the methodology behind each scanning module, highlighting the innovation and integration of cutting edge technologies. Additionally, practical use cases and real-world scenarios are presented to demonstrate the tool’s effectiveness in identifying and addressing security concerns in diverse network environments.
